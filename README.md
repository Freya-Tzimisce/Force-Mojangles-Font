# Force Mojangles Font

This mod is a Fabric port of [Force ASCII Font](https://github.com/ZekerZhayard/ForceASCIIFont/)

Before Minecraft 1.13, if the language file of the corresponding language contains non-ASCII characters, all charactors will be rendered as unicode font style.

This mod will solve this issue.
